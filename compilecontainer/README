First install and start docker, and then:

On OS X:
  Replace `sudo -u $HOSTUSER make` with `make` in ./startup
  Replace `REPO_DIR="$(readlink -f $SCRIPT_DIR/..)"` with `REPO_DIR="/the/absolute/path/to/the/repo"`
  (optional: submit a PR that makes this unnecessary)

./build
./run

This will compile the code and you will be dropped
into a psql shell on a server with shards already set up.
The front-end lives in the database `shard`
The backends live in the databases `shard0` and shard1`

Take a look in ../manual_test.sql to see what
commands are available.
